### The LoginRadius Solution
We provide a highly secure and compliant website and mobile app that was easy to use and created seamless customer experiences. We provide login platform technology that would allow customers to seamlessly implement our platform into their website or mobile application. Now, LoginRadius helps to build the interface that delights the customer and will help them in keeping their essential data safe and secure.

“LoginRadius is innovative, and thought along with health sector companies to develop the right solutions,”  LoginRadius provides a solution in which customers can enter their DigiDs where they can download the app, and then use a single sign-on for all interactions after that. This will help end-users to log in quickly, while also creating a convenient user experience. And of course, LoginRadius is all about security. So we were certain that our customers’ data would remain secure in every interaction.” 

#### 1. Integrating Single Sign-On with the Health insurance sector.
With LoginRadius’ assistance, companies will be able to implement Single Sign-On with an important syndication partner to provide insurance claims and other insurance products. This will allows users to directly access the business content from the partner’s portal.
### 2. Doximity as a Custom ID Provider
Doximity is a social network specific to medical professionals and therefore is not a readily available social login provider. LoginRadius, however, was able to integrate Doximity as a custom identity provider for industry-specific social login.

### 3. National Provider Identification (NPI) integration
LoginRadius provided a custom registration NPI registration page where the users’ NPI numbers are verified with the NPI registry in real-time. As well, the form auto-fills with the information that is retrieved from the NPI registry.
### 4. Custom Object
LoginRadius configured the custom object to ensure that all of the data required by companies are properly and securely stored, including the data retrieved via the NPI registry and the learning progress (or viewing history) of individual users, to name a few.

The virtues are innumerable

- A secure, hassle-free sign-in experience is the minimum that today’s customers expect from a modern organization. However, they are not the only virtues of this solution. A basic CIAM system can provide many advanced functionalities for a company and its customers, including:
- Advanced login options
- Optimized data collection
- Consent management
 
 
# Conclusions
Customer identity and access management have many great features that ensure consumers are at the center of business strategy. However, this does not mean that each company has to change everything at once.
It’s important for organizations to start the change from a point where they feel comfortable and scale their business needs to match their digital maturity level. The progressive adoption of a CIAM solution can bring great benefits to companies.
On the other hand, this solution provides the flexibility that companies require to accommodate the latest technologies and trends that extend their businesses outside the traditional perimeter. It provides enormous benefits to the organization in terms of complying with growing compliance reforms and secure access to personal information, reducing data breaches. It also lowers the burden on IT due to the self-service functionality it offers.
